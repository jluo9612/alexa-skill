Welcome! This is my first Alexa skill development project.

With this skill, Alexa can ask for starting and ending locations to figure out the total cost of gas if one were to drive from starting point to the ending point.

For the MVP, keep the intents and utterances extremely simple. Now we just need two locations and Alexa will calculate the cost. 

When it's done with one calculation, ask the user if they want to calculate for different locations. 


There are some things we want to have in the future:


- The user can specify the model of their car for a more accurate approximation of cost

- Compare driving costs with alternative transportation costs, e.g. flight
